# GMIT-Fundaments-of-Data-Analysis---Project

### Project 2018 Fundaments of Data Analysis

#### Problem Statement

The box plot is common in data analysis for investigating individual numerical variables. In this project students are to investigate and explain box plots and their uses. The boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot can be used to create box plots. Submission should be in the form of a repository containing a Jupyter notebook in which students detail their findings. In their notebook students should:

- Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it is used.
-  Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of their choosing.
- Explain and relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile.
- Compare the box plot to alternatives.

#### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Create a GitHub account and clone or copy the repository. Public access has been granted to the repository and is available for use under the terms of the APACHE licence. 

Link: https://github.com/SimonMcLain/GMIT-Programming-for-Data-Analysis---Practicals.git

To run the file open it in Juypter notebook, with is included in the anaconda download. See Prerequsites below. 

On the command line access the repository on your local machine, run Juypter notebook and open the file named numpy-random.ipynb.

Once the file is open in Jupyter notebook on the ribbon click on Kernal, then restart and run all. The charts and descriptive statistics will be displayed.


#### Prerequisites

Your will require Python to be loaded on your local machine. I recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.
